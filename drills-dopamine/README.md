# Modernizing Tensorflow Implementation with Google Dopamine

This module uses Google's recently released [Dopamine](https://github.com/google/dopamine) which sets up a framework for researching reinforcement learning algorithms. This new version of DRiLLS adopts Dopamine to make it easier to implement the model and session classes.
